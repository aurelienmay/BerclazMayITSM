# BerclazMayITSM

This project was carried out as part of the "624-2 - Software Engineering" module for the IT Service Management (ITSM) course.

## Installation

Just unzip the zip and open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio.

## Usage

Make sure that the WindowsFormsTestWebservice project is launched as the startup project. And then you can launch it from Visual Studio.

## Common bug

An error may occur when executing an operation in Windows Form. If the error is of type "No listening endpoint on localhost", simply remove the "ServiceReferencePayment" service from the connected services and add it again with exactly the same name to resolve this error.
